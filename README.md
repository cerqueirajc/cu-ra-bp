This is a undergraduate research project developed in 2014/15 and sponsored by CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico) and LNLS (Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron). Most of the code and the data used during the project was lost. However, I decided to open the source code that is left. Hope this piece of work helps someone, and do not forget to get in touch!
